//1) A static int variable remains in memory while the program is running. A normal or auto variable is destroyed when a function call where the variable was declared is over. 
//For example, we can use static int to count a number of times a function is called, but an auto variable canâ€™t be used for this purpose
//Static variables (like global variables) are initialized as 0 if not initialized explicitly.
